        <p>Wild Ale (8.0%)</br>Lakeshore Hawk is a mixed culture barrel-fermented ale, brewed in collaboration with Horus Aged Ales, using techniques and recipe inputs from both of our breweries.</br>Lakeshore Hawk initially fermented with Kyle's culture in two French oak puncheons for 6 months. Eventually, we transferred the beer into our American oak foedre for its final 3-month rest with the live yeast and bacteria that we've cultivated in the oak over time. The particular combination of microorganisms, physical environment, and time, came together to create a truly elegant beer that we are very pleased with. Lakeshore Hawk is expressively citrus-forward, rounded out by the oak, with a champagne-like finish.</p>

Dried floral overtones and quiet citrus bring the beer together, married around qualities of white grape must, grey pepper, faint berries and green leaves. Oak brings harmony to the whole group.</br>Conditioned on orange peel, chamomile, coriander, mace, and ginger.</p>

        <h3 class="beer-name">If You're Feeling Sinister</h3>
        <p>Imperial Stout (13.0%)</br>Let’s start off by saying we thoroughly enjoy brewing with adjuncts, aging in barrels, and the endless possibilities both provide. However, this winter we found ourselves nostalgic for some of our favorite classic stouts, specifically of the Russian Imperial variety. We decided to strip things back down to the basics, and challenge ourselves to brew something truly decadent, rich, and complex, without the aid of adjuncts or wood.</br>If You’re Feeling Sinister is the result of that endeavor. And, it’s exactly what we were aiming for. Bold and uncompromising, this beer expresses rich flavors of caramelized sugar, dark chocolate, and espresso. Hints of toffee and toasted marshmallow complement the silky but full body, providing a truly indulgent experience. We hope you enjoy.</p>
