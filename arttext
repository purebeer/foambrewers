and an avenue to make the artwork more attainable than the mediums these artists typically work in

16 individual artists, New Duds, and Foam present Art From Home, an online art project exploiting t-shirts as the canvas. These artists are people we collaborate with on a variety of projects, from can labels to art exhibits, workshops, live painting, and more. Over the years, we have come to rely heavily on this community. However, during this pandemic, there are financial and physical barriers preventing collaboration in our typical ways. That doesn't mean ideas aren't flowing, or that the world has any less need for creativity and art. We believe the opposite. We believe that art is an essential part of healthy communities, inspiring us, provoking change, and adding much-needed beauty to a challenging world. That is how this project came to be. It fulfills our need to create and collaborate during a time of social distancing and incredible uncertainty. And, it directly supports our artists, an essential part of the Foam community. $15 from each shirt will go to the respective artist that designed it. The remaining $10 covers New Duds costs of printing and materials. We keep none of it.

We would like to thank all participating artists for their contributions to this project, past collaborations, and many future ones to come. We wouldn't be here without you.

Art From Home.

Sixteen individual artists, New Duds, and Foam present Art From Home, an online art project exploiting t-shirts as the canvas.
