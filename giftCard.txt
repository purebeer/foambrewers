In light of the current circumstances, we have made temporary but drastic changes to our business to mitigate the health and safety effects of COVID-19 on our staff, patrons, and community.

That being said, these measures will drastically reduce the income of our business right as we are supposed to be getting out of our slowest season of the year.

We are offering a 20% discount on gift cards for folks who want an awesome experience to look forward to in the future. We know it is a difficult time for many financially, and we absolutely understand purchasing something for the future is not possible for everyone. However, we appreciate any support in these trying times. Gift cards can be used at both the brewery and our new restaurant, Deep City.

We will continue to update you as things develop. We wish everyone good health and safety during this difficult time, and our hearts go out to all who are affected by the illness, both directly and indirectly.

$50 Gift Card for use at our brewery, or restaurant (Deep City), in Burlington VT.

Note: This gift card CAN NOT be used for online purchases.
