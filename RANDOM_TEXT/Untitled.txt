In response to COVID-19, we have made the incredibly difficult decision to postpone the opening of Deep City. While this puts our business and our team in a very uncertain place financially, we know this is best for the safety and health of our team, customers, and community at large. Stay tuned while we roll out a take-out service and don't forget to look for the silver lining.

This past weekend we had an incredible soft opening at Deep City thanks to many of you folks. Now, as we face a difficult time in Burlington and beyond, we are not able to open our restaurant this Thursday in the way we had hoped we would. Instead, we are going to be offering takeout starting on Thursday, and we'll be postponing our dine-in opening until the state and the industry decides restaurants should reopen. While this puts our business and our team in a very uncertain place financially, we know this is best for the safety and health of our team, customers, and community at large.

We would like to start off this post by thanking our incredible team, those of your who helped build Deep City, and those of you who joined us for our soft openings last week. After a wild journey, we finished the weekend in a state of confusion. This past Sunday concluded with two simultaneous realizations. One, we were finally ready to open the doors and welcome everyone to experience the new restaurant and bar. Two, we could not actually open as intended, in good conscious.
